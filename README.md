# DL-with-TensorFlow

[Building Deep Learning Models with TensorFlow](https://www.coursera.org/learn/building-deep-learning-models-with-tensorflow/)

The course explain foundational TensorFlow concepts such as the main functions, operations and the execution pipelines, describe how TensorFlow can be used in curve fitting, regression, classification and minimization of error functions. Taught the different types of Deep Architectures, such as Convolutional Networks, Recurrent Networks and Autoencoders.
